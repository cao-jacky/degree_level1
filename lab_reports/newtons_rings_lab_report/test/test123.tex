\section{test}
The half-life of Ba-137m and the Poisson and Gaussian probabilities for Am-241 can be calculated by collecting the activity and time period obtained from radioactive decay. Using a Geiger-M\"{u}ller tube and software such as \textit{CASSY Labs} and Excel it is possible to do so. The values obtained for half-life are $t\textsubscript{1/2-CSY}=2.73\pm0.03$ mins and $t\textsubscript{1/2-EXL}=2.92\pm0.07$ mins, which are consistent with literature. The experimental probability does not fit the theoretical probability distributions due to incomplete data set.
