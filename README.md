# degree_level1

work here includes:

* programming work from level 1 - mini project, main project, and work done for workshop
	* my coding style has increased significantly since then, there is less swearing and more structure/order to my work
* lab reports from level 1 - the lab reports which i completed for my labs module, the raw tex files are included along with any of the work which i did.
